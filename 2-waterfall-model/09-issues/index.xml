    <title>Waterfall Issues :: K-State CIS 642/643 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis642-643/2-waterfall-model/09-issues/</link>
    <description>You may be wondering, if this model of software engineering was so widely adopted, why did so many software projects continue to fail? Of course, some development houses never adopted a formal model, and rather continued in cowboy coding practices. But there were also many flaws in how the waterfall model was commonly adopted.&#xA;The ability to divide labor amongst the different phases was a boon from a business perspective, but it came with challenges.</description>
