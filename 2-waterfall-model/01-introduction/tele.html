<p>The <em>waterfall</em> model of software development breaks the process of creating software into discrete phases, as seen in this diagram:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-1d17d87f7b2b8b0de901b67c7c13ca99" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="The Basic Waterfall Model" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cis642-643/images/2.1.1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-1d17d87f7b2b8b0de901b67c7c13ca99"><img alt="The Basic Waterfall Model" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cis642-643/images/2.1.1.png"></a></p>
<p>The phases correspond to specific steps that must be carried out to create the software:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Requirements</em> involves determining exactly what the software needs to do, as well as what platform(s) it needs to run on.</li>
<li><em>Design</em> involves designing the software system to meet those requirements - i.e. laying out a high-level architecture, often specifying this architecture with UML or similar approaches.</li>
<li><em>Implementation</em> is the actual <em>programming</em> of the system.</li>
<li><em>Verification</em> is the process by which the software is tested to ensure it works and does what it was intended to do</li>
<li><em>Maintenance</em> is the phase in which the software is used, and consists of fixing bugs as they are found, and possibly adding new features.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach is based on engineering practices, and is more or less the strategy employed by NASA on the Apollo project. We&rsquo;ll spend the next few sections exploring the individual phases in detail, and then discuss how widely adopted the waterfall approach is, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
