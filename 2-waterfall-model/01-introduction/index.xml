    <title>Introduction :: K-State CIS 642/643 Textbook</title>

    <description>The waterfall model of software development breaks the process of creating software into discrete phases, as seen in this diagram:&#xA;The phases correspond to specific steps that must be carried out to create the software:&#xA;Requirements involves determining exactly what the software needs to do, as well as what platform(s) it needs to run on. Design involves designing the software system to meet those requirements - i.e. laying out a high-level architecture, often specifying this architecture with UML or similar approaches.</description>
