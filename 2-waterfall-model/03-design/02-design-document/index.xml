    <description>The outcome of the design phase is a design document. It provides a design, or specification, for a software system. You can think of it like an architectâ€™s blueprints provide the details for construction tradesmen to build a building - it provides rich enough direction that skilled laborers can follow in carrying out their portion of the work. In the waterfall model, the design document fulfills a similar role - it allows the work of building a software system to be broken down and assigned to different programmers focusing on a specific aspect of the system.</description>
