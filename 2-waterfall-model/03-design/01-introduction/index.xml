    <description>The second step in any kind of software development project should be to develop a plan of how the software should be built - ideally before any code is written. This is what design is all about. This is also the antithesis to cowboy coding which is likely how you learned to program. Working on a software system without a clear plan lies at the heart of many software project failures.</description>
