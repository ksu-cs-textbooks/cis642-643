    <title>UX Diagrams :: K-State CIS 642/643 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis642-643/2-waterfall-model/03-design/05-ux-diagrams/</link>
    <description>A UX (for user experience, aka user interface) diagram visually presents what the user sees on the screen of a device running the program in a simplified form. These are also sometimes called wireframes (due to the diagram typically only showing text and outlines of controls) or bluelines (a term borrowed from architecture, where plans are drawn in blue pencil before begin printed in black and white). Typically, each screen of the user interface is drawn as a UX diagram, along with a description of the purpose of the controls on the page.</description>
