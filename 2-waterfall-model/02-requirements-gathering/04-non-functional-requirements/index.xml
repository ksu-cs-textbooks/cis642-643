    <title>Non-Functional Requirements :: K-State CIS 642/643 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis642-643/2-waterfall-model/02-requirements-gathering/04-non-functional-requirements/</link>
    <description>There are typically non-functional requirements in every software development project as well. These arenâ€™t captured in the software we are developing, but inform our choices of platform, language, and approach.&#xA;Non-functional requirements commonly include:&#xA;Hardware The hardware that will be available for the software to run on. This might be determined by what the customer already has, or they may be intending to purchase new hardware - in which case the software developers may be able to make recommendations.</description>
