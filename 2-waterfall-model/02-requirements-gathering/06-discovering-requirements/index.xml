    <title>Discovering Requirements :: K-State CIS 642/643 Textbook</title>

    <description>A final challenge in discovering requirements is that your customers may not do a great job of telling them to you. We sometimes describe requirements as falling into one of three categories:&#xA;Conscious Unconscious Undreamed The conscious requirements are those your customer is aware of; correspondingly, they’re the easiest to gather because the customer shares them.&#xA;In contrast, unconscious requirements are those that are so deeply ingrained in the way the customer thinks and works that it doesn’t even occur to them that someone not involved in their work would not see it.</description>
