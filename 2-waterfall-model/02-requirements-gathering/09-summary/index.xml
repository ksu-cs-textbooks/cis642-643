    <title>Summary :: K-State CIS 642/643 Textbook</title>

    <description>Requirements gathering sets the stage for the rest of the waterfall process, and is critical for understanding the needs an scope of the program you will be developing. This process begins with obtaining business requirements from the customer, and should include input from all stakeholders. This information is gathered through formal information-gathering processes borrowed from the social sciences.&#xA;These business requirements should be broken down into functional requirements fine-grained enough to give the developers a clear picture of what the software will need to accomplish.</description>
