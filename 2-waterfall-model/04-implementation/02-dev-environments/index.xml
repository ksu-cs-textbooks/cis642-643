    <description>Implementation work takes place in a development environment - traditionally, a powerful PC with extra tools (compilers, code editors, debuggers, etc) installed. Moreover, the compiler/interpreter is typically run in a debug mode throughout the development process, which injects extra tooling into the compiled/interpreted program to allow for the display of debug information (i.e. giving memory state at breakpoints, etc.). While this makes for a more powerful and speedier development process, there are some implications to keep in mind:</description>
