      <description>The implementation phase of the waterfall should be the most familiar to you, as it is the actual process of creating the proposed software system. This is, after all, the subject of most of your early coursework - the basics of programming, algorithm design, and considering time and memory complexity of your employed algorithms.&#xA;It is critical that the implementation adhere to the details provided by the design, as this ensures that a large body of programmers can work independently on the aspects of the system.</description>

      <description>Implementation work takes place in a development environment - traditionally, a powerful PC with extra tools (compilers, code editors, debuggers, etc) installed. Moreover, the compiler/interpreter is typically run in a debug mode throughout the development process, which injects extra tooling into the compiled/interpreted program to allow for the display of debug information (i.e. giving memory state at breakpoints, etc.). While this makes for a more powerful and speedier development process, there are some implications to keep in mind:</description>
