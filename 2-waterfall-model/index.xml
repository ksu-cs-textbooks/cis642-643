      <description>The waterfall model of software development breaks the process of creating software into discrete phases, as seen in this diagram:&#xA;The phases correspond to specific steps that must be carried out to create the software:&#xA;Requirements involves determining exactly what the software needs to do, as well as what platform(s) it needs to run on. Design involves designing the software system to meet those requirements - i.e. laying out a high-level architecture, often specifying this architecture with UML or similar approaches.</description>

      <description>You may be wondering, if this model of software engineering was so widely adopted, why did so many software projects continue to fail? Of course, some development houses never adopted a formal model, and rather continued in cowboy coding practices. But there were also many flaws in how the waterfall model was commonly adopted.&#xA;The ability to divide labor amongst the different phases was a boon from a business perspective, but it came with challenges.</description>
