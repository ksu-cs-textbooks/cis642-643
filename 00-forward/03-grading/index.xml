    <title>Grading :: K-State CIS 642/643 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis642-643/00-forward/03-grading/</link>
    <description>Web Only This textbook was authored for the CIS 642/643 - Software Engineering Project I&amp;II course at Kansas State University. This front matter is specific to that course. If you are not enrolled in the course, please disregard this section.&#xA;As an experiential course intended to prepare you for the transition to industry, grading operates a bit differently in this class. We will be employing criterion grading. With criterion grading, your work is either deemed “acceptable” or “unacceptable”.</description>
