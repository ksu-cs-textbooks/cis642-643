    <title>Early Programming :: K-State CIS 642/643 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis642-643/1-history-of-software/02-early-programming/</link>
    <description>You probably remember seeing pictures of the room-sized ENIAC, the first digial computer constructed in the United States, in CIS 115. But do you remember how it was programmed?&#xA;Thatâ€™s actually what these two women - Gloria Ruth Gordon Bolotsky and Esther Gertson - are doing in the picture. They are programming the ENIAC by plugging jumper cables into a switchboard. Effectively, programming the ENIAC consisted of physically rewiring the computer to support the new program.</description>
