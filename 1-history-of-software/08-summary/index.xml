    <title>Summary :: K-State CIS 642/643 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis642-643/1-history-of-software/08-summary/</link>
    <description>If you paid attention to the dates in the previous section, then you know the software crisis is still very much with us, despite all the improvements in programming languages, tools, and management practices. The best defense against project failure may well be found in software engineering processes, which is the subject we will be studying for the rest of the book.&#xA;But just like any process, if it is misapplied, poorly followed, or simply blindly followed for the sake of procedure it will not succeed.</description>
