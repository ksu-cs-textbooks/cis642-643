<p>The unfolding software crisis was coupled to the growth of computing.  As Edsger Dijkstra put it in his 1972 ACM Turing Award acceptance speech: <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>

To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem.

<p>This increase in computing power was matched by increases in affordability, as the sampling of computers in the following table demonstrate.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, governments, corporations, schools, and even individuals purchased computers in larger and larger quantities, and the demand for software to run on these platforms and meet these customers&rsquo; needs likewise grew. Coupled with this rising demand for programs was a demand for skilled software developers, as reflected in the following table of graduation rates in programming-centric degrees:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-ad9ca223df51911365f2762dc8b601f2" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Annual Computer-Related Bachelor Degrees Awarded in the US" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cis642-643/images/0.4.1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-ad9ca223df51911365f2762dc8b601f2"><img alt="Annual Computer-Related Bachelor Degrees Awarded in the US" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cis642-643/images/0.4.1.png"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this graduation rate often lagged far behind the demand for skilled graduates, and was marked by several periods of intense growth (the period from 1965 to 1985, 1995-2003, and the current surge beginning around 2010).  During these surges, it was not uncommon to see students hired directly into the industry after only a course or two of learning programming (coding boot camps are a modern equivalent of this trend).</p>
<p>Try to imagine yourself taking a professional programming job after your first programming course - what quality of software do you think you would be writing?</p>
<p>For that matter, how do you write programs now?  Do you <em>read the entire assignment</em> before you start writing your program (if you&rsquo;re like most of my students, I know you don&rsquo;t).  Do you draw out diagrams of your software&rsquo;s architecture <em>before</em> you start coding?  Do you write down <em>exactly what you want the program to do</em> before you start coding?  Or do you just dive in and start writing code?</p>
<p>This latter approach is often called <em>cowboy coding</em>, after the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_Western" rel="external" target="_blank">spaghetti westerns</a> where the protagonist does not play by the rules.  Cowboy coding is marked by a lack of discipline and process. Effectively it it the antithesis of software engineering.</p>
