    <title>Evolution of Programming :: K-State CIS 642/643 Textbook</title>

    <description>The poor programming practices of cowboy coding and the growing numbers of unskilled programmers did not go unremarked. In fact, many of the programming language features you are familiar with were developed explicitly to counter these trends - i.e. to ‘idiot-proof’ programming.&#xA;Consider all the control-flow constructs you know: the for loop, the while loop, the if/else statement, the switch statement, the ternary operator, etc. None of these existed in early programming languages.</description>
