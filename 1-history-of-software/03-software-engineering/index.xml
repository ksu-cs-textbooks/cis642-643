    <description>The Apollo missions were marked for their heavy use of computers. For example, this next picture is the memory core of an Apollo Guidance Computer, developed for the Apollo missions. The two hands you see in the picture belong to professional weavers who were hired to implement the program for the mission. The program was encoded using core rope memory, a kind of read-only memory that stored 0 and 1 values by the inclusion or omission of a wire through a series of tiny magnetic rings.</description>
