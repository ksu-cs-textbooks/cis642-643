The second step in any kind of software development project _should_ be to develop a plan of how the software should be built - _before_ any code is written.  This is what _design_ is all about.  This is also the antithesis to _cowboy coding_ discussed in the prior chapter, which lies at the heart of many software project failures.

This section will examine in detail how such plans are developed and documented.

### Key Terms 

Some key terms in this chapter are:
* Design Document
