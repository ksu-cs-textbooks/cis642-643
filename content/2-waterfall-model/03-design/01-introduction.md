The second step in any kind of software development project should be to develop a plan of how the software should be built - ideally _before_ any code is written.  This is what _design_ is all about.  This is also the antithesis to [cowboy coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding) which is likely how you learned to program. Working on a software system without a clear plan lies at the heart of many software project failures.

This section will examine in detail how such plans are developed and documented.
