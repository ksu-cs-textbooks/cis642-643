The daily stand-up is a brief meeting where each team member presents what they are doing.  It's a kind of check-in to make sure the whole team knows what its members are working on.  The name "stand up" comes from the common practice of holding this meeting with everyone standing - so that they want to finish the meeting quicker.

Often the stand-up consists of each team member answering three questions:
1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. Is anything blocking your progress?

This helps keep the team on-track, as well as identifying any problems that need addressed (note the problems are not typically addressed during the stand-up itself).

## Daily Stand-Ups for our Class
Rather than try to hold a traditional stand-up, which is trickly in a school environment, we will use an asynchronous substitute.  In your MS Teams Channel, each weekday (and optionally weekend days) you should post your stand-up response. The TA will be reviewing these as part of your **process fidelity** grade.

If you choose, your team may also hold regular video-based stand-ups; just please also post the text version.
