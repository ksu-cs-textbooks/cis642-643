If you paid attention to the dates in the previous section, then you know the software crisis is still very much with us, despite all the improvements in programming languages, tools, and management practices.  The best defense against project failure may well be found in software engineering processes, which is the subject we will be studying for the rest of the book.  

But just like any process, if it is misapplied, poorly followed, or simply blindly followed for the sake of procedure it will not succeed.  Many of the software projects listed in the previous section _did_ engage in a software engineering process, yet failed nonetheless. Keep this in mind as you learn these processes, and try to understand the underlying _purpose_ of each step.
