This textbook was authored for the **CIS 642/643 - Software Engineering Project I&II** course at Kansas State University.  This front matter is specific to that course.  If you are not enrolled in the course, please disregard this section.

As an experiential course intended to prepare you for the transition to industry, grading operates a bit differently in this class.  We will be employing _criterion grading_.  With criterion grading, your work is either deemed "acceptable" or "unacceptable".  Acceptable work earns a 100%, while unacceptable earns 0%.  **Note there is no partial credit in criterion grading!** 

While this may seem harsh at first, it parallels what you can expect on the job.  If you regularly turn in "almost-there" work in a professional setting, you can expect to be looking for a new job in short order.  Your work **must** be of acceptable level.  Of course, you should strive to do _exceptional_ work rather than just acceptable - so there is a possible 5% bonus on critiera-graded assignments for exceptional work.

### Attendance Grades
Rather than taking attendance every day, which cuts into our class time, I instead record absences as negative points in the corresponding categories.  You can find two assignments in the **Absences** module: 
* _Team Meeting Absences_ will be used to record absences from regular team meetings, i.e. the stand-ups and check-ins.  These are held during the class period, so there is no reason to miss them.
* _Formal Meeting Absences_ will be used to record abences from the formal team meetings - i.e. _Sprint Planning_ and _Sprint Review_ meetings.  These are the meetings where you present your work and plan future work **with your customers** so absences here are a big deal.  Each absence will deduct points equivalent to a drop of a letter grade in the course.

Be aware that missing _three_ formal meetings automatically lowers your grade below a C - which means you can no longer count the course for your degree requirements!  And missing _two_ formal meetings will drop you to a C - which means you will need an otherwise perfect grade to maintain a C.

### Peer and Customer Reviews
Not all assignments are criterion-graded.  Specifically, the _peer review_ and _customer review_ assignments are based on a survey given to your team members and customers, respectively.  This survey asks them to evaluate you on a scale of 1 to 10 across several categories.  Instead of translating directly to a grade, we use the following calculation:

```
Base score = 100 points
-10 points for each category averaging 6 or 7 points
-20 points for each category averaging 4 or 5 points
-30 points for each category below 3 points
```

This means that a category score of 8, 9, or 10 is "acceptable" and does not impact your grade.  However, a score of 8 does suggest you have room to improve in this category, and should strive to do so.  Keep this in mind when you fill out peer reviews for your teammates - you can rate them at an 8 or 9 to indicate that you see room for improvement without hurting thier grade.
